"""
This file contains all the functions that are used to generate graphs.
You don't have to modify this code while running, the files that actually handle the simulating will call on these functions directly.
If, however, you want to modify what the functions are doing (how many eigenvectors you calculate, 
what kind of random distributions you use for generating points around the circumference of the circle, change the title of the graphs, etc.),
you should modify these functions and recompile the file your using the simulate the graphs (otherwise the edits will not be taken into account
when running). I tried to annotate all the variables clearly. If some function calls are confusing, I suggest looking up the documentation
for scipy / numpy libraries that I reference.
If you want to add functions that can be called from the main simulating file, you can also add them here, and they won't clutter your main file. :)
