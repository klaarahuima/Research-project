# BELOW: An ideal circulant graph, such that the 1st quadrant has EXACTLY twice as many vertices in 1st quadrant, and all vertices are evenly spaced
# Vertices in 1st quadrant connected to 4 nearest vertices, and the rest of the vertices are connected to 2 nearest vertices
# Used to observe behaviour of an 'ideal' version of the random graph model
# uncomment both lines below

# G = cry.generate_graph(order)
# fun.add_eigenvectors(G, 0, 1)

# BELOW: A nearest neighbours model graph, with 10 000 vertices and every vertex is connected to its 1500 nearest neighbours

# G = fun.nearest_neighbours(10000, 1500)

#BELOW: A general cycle graph
